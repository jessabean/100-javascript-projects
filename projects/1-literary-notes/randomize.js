    "title": "Inspector Singh Investigates: A Most Peculiar Malaysian Murder",
    "author": "Shamini Flint",
    "quote": "Singaporeans were always adding to the list of reasons each one kept to hand, in case they met a Malaysian, of why it was so much better on the island than the peninsula. They ranged from law and order to cleanliness, from clean government to good schools, and always ended on the strength of the Singaporean economy. But in the end, the Malaysian would nod as if to agree to the points made&mdash;and then shrug to indicate that they probably wouldn’t trade passports, not really. And if pressed for a reason they would fall back on that old chestnut which somehow seemed to capture everything that was wrong about Singapore – but your government bans chewing gum."

    "quote": "For every soldier who went to battle, a hundred civilians moved ahead of him&mdash;to get out of the way; or behind him&mdash;following in his wake the way leaves are pulled along in a cyclone, hoping to live off his garbage, his money, and when all else failed, his mercy."

    "author": "Shamini Flint",
    "quote": "He had overheard expatriate wives complain of the poor service in Singapore restaurants and service stations, conveniently forgetting the surly student waiters in London or the self-service petrol stations in Sydney.

    "author": "Kao Kalia Yang",
    "quote": "The Hmong in Laos had fled from China. Legends told of war and murder, slavery and escape. The Hmong language had been outlawed. The written language was hidden in flowers. It was a women's rebellion; they devised a plan to hide their stories in their clothing, in the child-carrying clothes that bound their children to themselves. They did not know that in the passage of time the written language would become lost in the beautiful shapes and colors, no longer legible in words, holding on to meaning."

    "quote": "Ah! what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!<br />Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade<br />To shepherds looking on their silly sheep<br />Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy<br />To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?<br />O yes, it doth; a thousandfold it doth."

    "author": "Diana Gabaldon",
    "quote": "Lying on the floor, with the carved panels of the ceiling flickering dimly above, I found myself thinking that I had always heretofore assumed that the tendency of eigh­teenth-century ladies to swoon was due to tight stays; now I rather thought it might be due to the idiocy of eighteenth-century men."
